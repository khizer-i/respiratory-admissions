field,field_name,type,description
FYEAR,Financial Year,string,The financial year of the data. This is represented as the last two digits of the earlier year followed by the last two digits of the later year (e.g. 2008-09 is represented in this field as 0809)
PARTYEAR,HES Extract Year and Number,number,The data year (first four digits) and the extract number (final two digits). HES data years span calendar years (they run from 1st April to 31st March). In the PARTYEAR field, the year represents the lower year from the date span, e.g. for 2016-17 the year will appear in this field as 2016 on all records within that data year. HES extracts are currently taken once per month, with each extract superseding the previous one for that year. For example, a PARTYEAR of 201601 indicates that the data came from the first HES extract to be taken in the 2016-17 data year (April 2016 data only); 201602 is the second extract of 2016-17 (April and May 2016 data only, extracted a month later than the previous extract), etc. Where the PARTYEAR ends in 99, this indicates the final HES data set for that year - no further extracts of HES data for that year will be taken, and this data will not change. Where the PARTYEAR does not end in 99, this indicates that the data is provisional and is subject to change with subsequent extracts. Provisional extract numbers generally run from 01 (the first extract of the year) to 13 (the final extract of the year). 99 represents the final data set of the year, which is based on the month 13 extract with additional manual changes made to correct known issues or errors in the data.
EPIKEY,HES Record Identifier,string,This is the HES unique record identifier that should be used for linking across tables. EPIKEY values prior to 2021/22 were derived as part of HES processing. From 2021/22 these values are directly populated from the unique identifier generated by SUS. Hence the values will be the same as the SUSRECID from 2021/22 and can also be used to compare HES records with SUS.
PSEUDO_HESID,Pseudonymised Patient identifier - HES generated,string,A unique identifier for each individual patient. This allowed an individual’s care to be tracked across years and continuous periods to be identified. This was a pseudonymised version of the HES ID field based on an updated matching algorithm, which superseded and was compatible with the original HES ID. This field was replaced with the TOKEN_PERSON_ID field in 2021-22. PSEUDO_HESID is no longer available in HES.
ADMIDATE,Admission Date (Hospital Provider Spell),date,The date the patient was admitted to hospital at the start of a hospital spell. ADMIDATE is recorded on all episodes within the spell.
ADMIMETH,Method of Admission,string,A code to identify how the patient was admitted to hospital. ADMIMETH is recorded on the first and also all subsequent episodes within the spell (i.e. where the spell is made up of more than one episode).
ADMISORC,Source of Admission,A code to identify where the patient was immediately prior to admission. Most patients are admitted from home, but there are some significant exceptions. In particular, this field differentiates between patients admitted from home and patients transferred from another hospital provider or institution.
CCG_GP_PRACTICE,Sub Integrated Care Board of GP Practice (July 2022 onwards) Clinical Commissioning Group of GP Practice (until June 2022),string,The Sub Integrated Care Board (Sub ICB) / Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) area where the patient’s GP practice is registered. It is derived from the GP practice code (GPPRAC). Note: Sub ICBs replaced CCGs on 1st July 2022. The Organisation Data Serivce (ODS) codes that identified the 106 existing CCGs were retained and applied to the new Sub ICBs.
DIAG_4_01,Primary Diagnosis Code,string,There are twenty diagnosis fields that can be populated per episode from April 2007 (fourteen between April 2002 and March 2007, and seven before April 2002), DIAG_01 to DIAG_20, which contain information about a patient's illness or condition. The field DIAG_01 contains the primary diagnosis, which represents the main condition treated or investigated during the episode. The other diagnosis fields contain secondary/subsidiary diagnoses. The codes are defined in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of Death (ICD). On episodes from 1st April 1995, codes from the tenth revision of ICD (ICD-10) are used. Prior to April 1995, the ninth revision (ICD-9) is used. ICD-10 diagnosis codes start with a letter and are followed by two or three digits. The third digit identifies variations on a main diagnosis code containing two digits. The third digit is preceded by a full stop in ICD-10, but this is not stored in this field. The fifth character should be used in accordance with the National Clinical Coding Standards for (ICD-10), where it is not used the character should be filled with a '-'. The sixth character of the code is used to designate an asterisk or dagger indicator in ICD-10; it may be an 'A' or 'D'. The fifth and sixth characters are not validated in HES, therefore invalid characters can appear in these positions.Pivoted from DIAG_CODE.
DIAG_4_02,Secondary Diagnosis Code,string,See DIAG_4_01.
DIAG_4_03,Tertiary Diagnosis Code,string,See DIAG_4_01.
ETHNOS,Ethnic Category,string,The ethnicity of the patient, as specified by the patient. From April 2001 the codes were changed to represent the ethnic data categories as defined in the 2001 census. However, HES continued to accept the old codes as well as the new codes for the 2001-02 and 2002-03 data years. Prior to 1995-96, invalid codes may appear in this field. Ethnic category codes were not validated in HES before this date. 
FAE_EMERGENCY,Finished Admission Episode, Emergency Classification flag,number,The Finished Admission Episode, Emergency Classification flag indicates whether the episode is a Finished Admission Episode (FAE) from an emergency admission. This is set to a value of 1 where FAE = 1 and the Method of Admission (ADMIMETH) begins with 2.
RESCTY_ONS,County of Residence (ONS),string,The county of residence of the patient, derived in HES from the patient's postcode (HOMEADD).
SEX,Person Stated Gender Code,The current gender of the patient. The classification is phenotypical rather than genotypical, i.e. it does not provide codes for medical or scientific purposes.Notes: National Code 'Not Known' means that the sex of a person has not been recorded. National Code 'Not Specified' means indeterminate, i.e. unable to be classified as either male or female.
DISDATE,Date of Discharge,The date on which the patient was discharged from hospital. It is only populated on the final episode of the spell.
SPELBGIN, Beginning of Spell Indicator, number,This derived field contains a code that defines whether the episode is the first in a spell, and whether the spell started in the current year or a previous year. Other maternity events are excluded. 0 = Not the first episode of spell. 1 = First episode of spell that started in a previous year. 2 = First episode of spell that started in current year. Null = Not applicable
SPELEND,End of Spell Indicator,This derived field contains a code that defines whether the episode is the last in a spell. It is set on finished general, delivery and birth episodes (where EPISTAT = 3 and EPITYPE = 1, 2 or 3), provided the discharge method (DISMETH) confirms that the spell has finished. Y = Last episode of spell. N = Not last episode of spell
SPELDUR,Duration of Spell,number,This derived field gives the duration of the spell in days. It contains the difference in days between the admission date (ADMIDATE) and the episode end date (EPIEND) provided the discharge method (DISMETH) confirms that the spell has finished. If the episode has not finished it is calculated from the end of the year and ADMIDATE.
STARTAGE,Age at Start of Episode,number,"The  patient's age, in completed years, at the start of the episode. This field is derived in HES from the episode start date (EPISTART) and the patient's date of birth (DOB). For patients under 1 year old, special codes in the range 7001 to 7007 apply.
LSOA11,Lower Super Output Area of Residence 2011,string,The 2011 census Lower Layer Super Output Area (LSOA) code for England and Wales, Super Output Area (SOA) code for Northern Ireland, and Data Zone code for Scotland. Pseudo codes are included for Channel Islands and Isle of Man. The field will otherwise be blank for postcodes with no grid reference. N.B. this field remains blank for Scottish postcodes until this information is released. The first character is either E for England or W for Wales The next two characters are 01 for LSOA, and the remaining six characters make up the unique 6-digit tag for each zone. This field is derived in HES from the patient's postcode (HOMEADD).
imd_decile,Index of Multiple Deprivation Decile,integer,The deciles are calculated by ranking the 32,844 LSOAs in England from most deprived to least deprived and dividing them into 10 equal groups. LSOAs in decile 1 fall within the most deprived 10% of LSOAs nationally and LSOAs in decile 10 fall within the least deprived 10% of LSOAs nationally.
